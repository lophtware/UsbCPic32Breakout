# EDA Notes
The schematics in this directory were created with
[DesignSpark](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/pcb-software) 8.1.2
running via [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/) on
[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/).

DesignSpark is free software as in 'free beer' and not as in 'libre' but
does not require Windows to run.
